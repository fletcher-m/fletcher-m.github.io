    "text": "Finding Suitable Habitat for Oysters Along the California Coast\n\nData Wrangling\nFirst, I was interested in what portions of Califonia’s coastline would be suitable for Oysters. They have an ideal depth range of 0 to 70 meters and ideal temperature range of 11 to 30 degrees Celsius. In order to find where these parameters are met, I used data of annual sea surface temperatures from 2008 to 2012 and then also used bathymetry data of the ocean. These first series of steps involve me doing a bit of data wrangling and making sure that I would be able to stack my depth raster with my temperature raster. I had previously combined all 4 years of temperature data into a raster stack ‘all_sst’.\n\n# find mean SST\nall_sst_mean &lt;- mean(all_sst)\n\n# convert SST data to Celsius\nall_sst_mean &lt;- all_sst_mean - 273.15\n\n# crop depth to match SST raster\ndepth &lt;- crop(depth, all_sst_mean)\n\n# resample depth data to match SST resolution\ndepth &lt;- resample(x = depth, y =  all_sst_mean, method = \"near\")\n\n# check that that depth and SST match in resolution, extent and crs (by stacking them)\ndepth_sst &lt;- c(depth, all_sst_mean)\n\n\n\nSetting Raster Values to Align with Temperature and Depth Parameters\nAfter I had my depth and temperature rasters combined, I then needed to filter these rasters to the values that I wanted. As I mentioned above, Oysters like temperature between 11 and 33 degrees Celsius and do best in depths from 0 to 70 meters. After assigning these parameter values, I plotted areas along the coast that meet both of these criteria. The following is what I came up with:\n\nThe above plot shows the California coastline. In this plot, I have set values within temperature and depth parameters equal to “1” and combined both rasters. The colored regions represent areas that are within both of the specified depth and temperature regions.\n\n\nOverlaying Suitable Area with EEZ Regions\nNow that I had the area designated for suitable habitat for oysters, I wanted to explore which of the 5 EEZ regions along the west coast contained the most potential for oyster fishing. In order to do this, I needed to find the total suitable area within each EEZ region. Below is a plot showing each of the 5 regions and their corresponding total areas.\n\nAs you can see, by comparing this plot with the one above, all of the EEZ regions contain at least some suitable oyster habitat. Now, I needed to find out just how much area there was in each region."

Collecting data from the ocean, especially the deep ocean, is an incredibly costly and risky operation that only a select number of countries around the world are able to undertake. Although only a few countries collect this data, it is essential that lesser able sovereign states can access it in order to make their own decisions regarding climate change, fishing practices as well as many other commitments that have economic and social ramifications. There are efforts to confront this problem and I try to highlight a few of these."

Whether you are on its surface or beneath, the dynamics of wind, currents, waves and other factors set ocean-related activities far apart from those in the terrestrial environment. These difficult conditions, paired with the ocean’s expansive nature, require that a vast amount of resources go into collecting data there. It can cost more than US$30,000 per day to operate a modern research vessel, excluding the cost of scientific personnel and the actual research being done. (Lauro et al. 2014)."

It is associated with the hard sciences and, in relation to the ocean, it takes the form of sea surface temperature, counts of species, wind speed and other similar measurements. All of this collected information is incredibly vast and undeniably important. It is what allows us to conduct commerce, extract valuable resources and, hopefully, protect this natural environment. Something that is often neglected in this research is cultural data. This is something that is beginning to gain traction and is being interwoven into research being done. There is a wealth of policy-focused research on fisheries science and ocean acidification (“Raising and Integrating the Cultural Values of the Ocean | IUCN” 2017). Policy makers are able to take this research into account when they are forming decisions. For all of this available research, there is an equally insufficient amount of policy relevant documentation that describes the ocean as a cultural entity (“Raising and Integrating the Cultural Values of the Ocean | IUCN” 2017)."

    "section": "South Africa: A Case Study",
    "text": "South Africa: A Case Study\nFor many countries, the ocean plays a critical role in the economy. Naturally, with something so important, there should be deep knowledge and understanding. This is often not the case, due to funding restraints or other barriers to access. Operating without this knowledge can have ramifications for sustainability of resources and the overall contribution to local and global economies and cultures. South Africa can be used as an example of a nation highly reliant on the ocean and its resources but influenced by insufficient access to data. In South Africa, 85% of the mainland ocean territory is within the deep sea (Sink et al., n.d.).\n\n\n\nMap showing seafloor depths and the boundaries of South Africa’s continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012008.g002\n\n\nInformation about the deep sea in South Africa, as well as other nations, is necessary to understand how increased industrial activities (i.e., oil extraction) may affect marine ecosystems present in that area (Sink et al., n.d.). Additionally, a lack of information could lead to a country missing out on potentially beneficial marine resources (Sink et al., n.d.). You can see how a disparity could arise between a country with deep knowledge of its marine territory and one without. Even if two countries had the same resources present in their waters, you have to know that resource exists in order to develop strategies to acquire it. Beyond beneficial natural resources, there are many culturally important aspects of the deep sea in South Africa. For example, some Nguni cultures consider some of the most powerful ancestors to reside in the deep sea (Sink et al., n.d.).\nClearly, the ocean landscape is crucially important to South Africa, both for current projects as well as potential future ventures. A major issue there has been that the majority of research in that region has been conducted by international scientists and stakeholders of private companies, with very little to no local collaboration (Sink et al., n.d.). Much of the data collected by private industries was never published or shared with South African interests and some of it was even kept as confidential (Sink et al., n.d.). This is a direct threat to open data access and, as a result, research done by South Africa took an incomplete and fragmented path. This potentially could have slowed innovation in South African deep-sea technology and/or led to damaged ecosystems. Both could potentially have been minimized, had the data been accessible.\nAside from South African entities being unable to access externally collected data, there also has existed issues with the country of its citizens being able to access information from its organizations and government. The sink et. al. paper encapsulates this best by saying that “As a result of past laws of segregation, exclusion and discrimination, multiple sectors including biodiversity, marine science and marine management are still largely inaccessible to the vast majority of South African citizens, and there are significant barriers preventing general access to participation and opportunities” (Sink et al., n.d.). This is evidence that culture has a direct impact on science. Cultural aspects must be taken into account wherever data collection is taking place and not doing this can emit important explanations for bias."
