    "text": "In this blog post, I try to highlight the importance of open access to ocean data. Collecting data from the ocean, especially the deep ocean, is an incredibly costly and risky operation that only a select number of countries around the world are able to undertake. Although only a few countries collect this data, it is essential that lesser able sovereign states can access it in order to make their own decisions regarding climate change, fishing practices as well as many other commitments that have economic and social ramifications. There are efforts to confront this problem and I try to highlight a few of these."

    "text": "Background in Ocean Exploration and Feasability\nThe ocean has always been a difficult place to work in. Whether you are on its surface or beneath, the dynamics of wind, currents, waves and other factors set ocean-related activities far apart from those in the terrestrial environment. These difficult conditions, paired with the ocean’s expansive nature, require that a vast amount of resources go into collecting data there. It can cost more than US$30,000 per day to operate a modern research vessel, excluding the cost of scientific personnel and the actual research being done. (Lauro et al. 2014)."

    "section": "South Africa: A Case Study",
    "text": "South Africa: A Case Study\nFor many countries, the ocean plays a critical role in the economy. Naturally, with something so important, there should be deep knowledge and understanding. This is often not the case, due to funding restraints or other barriers to access. Operating without this knowledge can have ramifications for sustainability of resources and the overall contribution to local and global economies. South Africa can be used as an example of a nation highly reliant on the ocean and its resources but influenced by insufficient access to data. In South Africa, 85% of the mainland ocean territory is within the deep sea (Sink et al., n.d.).\n\n\n\nMap showing seafloor depths and the boundaries of South Africa’s continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012008.g002\n\n\nInformation about the deep sea in South Africa, as well as other nations, is necessary to understand how increased industrial activities (i.e., oil extraction) may affect marine ecosystems present in that area (Sink et al., n.d.). Additionally, a lack of information could lead to a country missing out on potentially beneficial marine resources (Sink et al., n.d.). You can see how a disparity could arise between a country with deep knowledge of its marine territory and one without. Even if two countries had the same resources present in their waters, you have to know that resource exists in order to develop strategies to acquire it. Beyond beneficial natural resources, there are many culturally important aspects of the deep sea in South Africa. For example, some Nguni cultures consider some of the most powerful ancestors to reside in the deep sea (Sink et al., n.d.).\nClearly, the ocean landscape is crucially important to South Africa, both for current projects as well as potential future ventures. A major issue there has been that the majority of research in that region has been conducted by international scientists and stakeholders of private companies, with very little to no local collaboration (Sink et al., n.d.). Much of the data collected by private industries was never published or shared with South African interests and some of it was even kept as confidential (Sink et al., n.d.). This is a direct threat to open data access and, as a result, research done by South Africa took an incomplete and fragmented path. This potentially could have slowed innovation in South African deep-sea technology and/or led to damaged ecosystems. Both could potentially have been minimized, had the data been accessible.\nAside from South African entities being unable to access externally collected data, there also has existed issues with the country of its citizens being able to access information from its organizations and government. The sink et. al. paper encapsulates this best by saying that “As a result of past laws of segregation, exclusion and discrimination, multiple sectors including biodiversity, marine science and marine management are still largely inaccessible to the vast majority of South African citizens, and there are significant barriers preventing general access to participation and opportunities” (Sink et al., n.d.). This is evidence that culture has a direct impact on science. Cultural aspects must be taken into account wherever data collection is taking place and not doing this can emit important explanations for bias."
