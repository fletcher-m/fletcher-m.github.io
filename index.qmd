Hi there! I'm Fletcher. I am a current MEDS (Master's of Environmental Data Science) student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management (UCSB). I have an academic background in environmental science and professional experience working on and under the ocean. Outside of school and work, I love spending time paddling outrigger canoe, hiking in the mountains and anything else that gets me outside. Feel free to learn more about me by exploring around my website.

## Education:

BS Environmental Studies, UCSB (2018)

Current Master's Student at Bren School, UCSB (Master's of Environmental Data Science)
