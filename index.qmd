Hi, I'm Fletcher.

I am a current MEDS (Master's of Environmental Data Science) student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I have spent most of my life either on or near the ocean, so my interests tend to pull me in that direction.  

## Education:

BS Environmental Studies (2018)

Current Master's Student at Bren, UCSB (Master's of Environmental Data Science)
