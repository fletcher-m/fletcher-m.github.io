When I was 7, my family (parents, sister, cat & dog) decided to buy a sailboat and go travel for a while. We began in Ventura, CA and slowly worked our way down the coast of California and down into Mexico and then Central America for 2 years. We ended up leaving the sailboat in El Salvador and moving to Lake Tahoe for the next 2 years. After enjoying the mountains and learning how to ski, we decided that we wanted to give travelling another shot. We moved back down onto the sailboat and traveled for another couple years, completing Central America and seeing some of northern South America. Our final leg consisted of us heading out to the Galapagos Islands and then back up to Mexico from there. Altogether, we were living full time on the boat for 5 years.     \n\n:::{.column-margin}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/family_boat.jpeg){fig-alt='A white sailboat with a blue stripe with the sails up, sailing downwind.' width=400}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.center-text .extra-small-text .dark-gray-text .topbr}\nMy family's boat \"Desiderata\" that we lived on for 5 years.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Daily Life on the Boat\nMany people hear that we lived on a sailboat and assume that it was like being on a vacation every day. In reality, our lifestyle required some hard work. We dealt with all of the same trials and tribulations of any family, and all in within a 41 foot boat. My sister and I were home schooled (or boat schooled I suppose) and we had weekly chores, just like other kids. The difference was that, after cleaning the bathrooms, we could walk up and jump right in the water.\n\n:::{.column-margin}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/machu.jpeg){fig-alt='My family standing in front of famous Incan ruins Machu Picchu' width=300}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.center-text .extra-small-text .dark-gray-text .topbr}\nStanding on Machu Picchu - one of the many amazing sights that we saw.\n:::\n:::\n\nOther areas of life on a boat are still possible, but much less convenient than if you were living in a house. For example, going to buy groceries was no longer as simple as hopping in a car and running out to the store. We were normally anchored offshore from a town, so our first step was to take our inflatable boat through the waves and haul it up onto the beach. We then needed to catch a bus that would take us to the store (sometimes it would be a half hour ride). After buying everything that we needed (or at least all that we could carry), we would make the trek back to the boat. Stocking up on groceries often turned into an all-day affair for us.  \n\nTravelling by sailboat has now become very popular. Every year, hundreds of boats leave from San Diego on their way to Mexico in an event called the \"Baja Ha Ha\". It's a great way for first-time sailors/travelers to meet others doing the same thing and have some support along the way. You can check out my family's full [website](https://sv-desiderata.com/) that documents our travels if you're interested to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
