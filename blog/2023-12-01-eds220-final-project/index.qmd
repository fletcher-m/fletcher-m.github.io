# Plotting AQI in Santa Barbara and Thomas Fire Burn Area Map

For this project, I looked into constructing a plot of air quality index (AQI) values for Santa Barbara from 2017 to 2018. I also constructed an overlay of the Thomas Fire burn area on a false color image of Santa Barbara county.

## Plotting Image of Santa Barbara

I first set about plotting an image of Santa Barbara using data collected from satellite. This first plot uses the "red", "green", and "blue" bands in order to create a true color image.

```{python}
# select red, green and blue variables from the NetCDF data and plot 
bands[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()
```
