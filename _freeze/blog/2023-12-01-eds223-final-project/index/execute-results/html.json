They have an ideal depth range of 0 to 70 meters and ideal temperature range of 11 to 30 degrees Celsius. In order to find where these parameters are met, I used data of annual sea surface temperatures from 2008 to 2012 and then also used bathymetry data of the ocean. These first series of steps involve me doing a bit of data wrangling and making sure that I would be able to stack my depth raster with my temperature raster. I had previously combined all 4 years of temperature data into a raster stack 'all_sst'.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# find mean SST\nall_sst_mean <- mean(all_sst)\n\n# convert SST data to Celsius\nall_sst_mean <- all_sst_mean - 273.15\n\n# crop depth to match SST raster\ndepth <- crop(depth, all_sst_mean)\n\n# resample depth data to match SST resolution\ndepth <- resample(x = depth, y =  all_sst_mean, method = \"near\")\n\n# check that that depth and SST match in resolution, extent and crs (by stacking them)\ndepth_sst <- c(depth, all_sst_mean)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Setting Raster Values to Align with Temperature and Depth Parameters\n\nAfter I had my depth and temperature rasters combined, I then needed to filter these rasters to the values that I wanted. As I mentioned above, Oysters like temperature between 11 and 33 degrees Celsius and do best in depths from 0 to 70 meters. After assigning these parameter values, I plotted areas along the coast that meet both of these criteria. The following is what I came up with:\n\n![](temp_depth.png)\n\nThe above plot shows the California coastline. In this plot, I have set values within temperature and depth parameters equal to \"1\" and combined both rasters. The colored regions represent areas that are within both of the specified depth and temperature regions.\n\n### Overlaying Suitable Area with EEZ Regions\n\nNow that I had the area designated for suitable habitat for oysters, I wanted to explore which of the 5 EEZ regions along the west coast contained the most potential for oyster fishing. In order to do this, I needed to find the total suitable area within each EEZ region. Below is a plot showing each of the 5 regions and their corresponding total areas.\n\n![](eez_regions.png)\n\nAs you can see, by comparing this plot with the one above, all of the EEZ regions contain at least some suitable oyster habitat. Now, I needed to find out just how much area there was in each region.\n",
