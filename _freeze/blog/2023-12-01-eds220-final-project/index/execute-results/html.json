I also constructed an overlay of the Thomas Fire burn area on a false color image of Santa Barbara county.\n\nLink to Github Repository: https://github.com/fletcher-m/aqi-thomas-fire-sb\n\n## Plotting Image of Santa Barbara\n\nI first set about plotting an image of Santa Barbara using data collected from satellite. This first plot uses the \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\" bands in order to create a true color image.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# select red, green and blue variables from the NetCDF data and plot \nbands[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](screenshot.jpeg)\n\nClearly, this is not what you should expect a true color image to look like. The issue here was that the clouds were providing reflectance values far greater than everything else, so I corrected to not include outlier values and got this image:\n\n![](images/map.png)\n\n",
